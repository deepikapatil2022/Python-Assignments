    "The `try` clause in Python is used to enclose the code that may raise an exception or an error during the program's execution. It is used to test a block of code for errors, exceptions or failures. The purpose of the `try` clause is to catch any errors or exceptions that might occur during the execution of the program and handle them gracefully, without causing the program to crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `except` clause in Python is used to handle the exceptions or errors that are caught by the `try` clause. It is used to specify the code that should be executed when an exception or error is raised. The purpose of the `except` clause is to catch the exception or error that was raised by the `try` clause and take appropriate action, such as printing an error message or logging the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, the `try` and `except` clauses form a `try`/`except` block in Python, which allows you to handle exceptions and errors in a controlled and graceful way. When an exception or error is raised in the `try` block, the program jumps immediately to the `except` block to handle the exception or error. By using a `try`/`except` block, you can ensure that your program continues to run even if an unexpected error or exception occurs."
