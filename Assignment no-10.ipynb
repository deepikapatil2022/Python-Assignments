    "==>The send2trash and shutil modules in Python provide functions for deleting files and directories, but they have some key differences:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The send2trash module is a third-party module that provides a safe way to send files or directories to the system's trash or recycle bin, rather than permanently deleting them. This means that you can recover them from the trash if needed.\n",
    "The main function provided by send2trash is send2trash.send2trash(path). This function moves the specified file or directory to the trash.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "import send2trash\n",
    "\n",
    "send2trash.send2trash('my_file.txt')\n",
    "This will move 'my_file.txt' to the trash, if supported by the operating system.\n",
    "shutil Module:\n",
    "\n",
    "The shutil module is part of the Python standard library and provides a wide range of file operations, including functions for copying, moving, and deleting files and directories.\n",
    "The shutil module contains the shutil.rmtree(path) function, which is used to recursively delete a directory and its contents. It does not send files to the trash; instead, it permanently deletes them.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "import shutil\n",
    "\n",
    "shutil.rmtree('my_directory')\n",
    "This will permanently delete the 'my_directory' and its contents.\n",
    "In summary, the main difference between the two modules is that send2trash provides a safe way to move files or directories to the system's trash or recycle bin, while shutil is used for performing various file operations, including permanently deleting files and directories.\n",
