    "1. To what does a relative path refer?\n",
    "==>A relative path refers to the location of a file or directory in relation to the current working directory. In other words, it specifies the path to a file or directory starting from the current directory, rather than from the root directory of the file system.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you have a file called \"myfile.txt\" located in a directory called \"documents\" that is inside the current working directory, the relative path to \"myfile.txt\" would be something like \"./documents/myfile.txt\" (assuming that \".\" represents the current directory).\n",
    "\n",
    "Relative paths are useful because they allow you to specify file locations in a way that is independent of the specific file system or operating system you are using. This makes it easier to move and share files and directories between different environments."
